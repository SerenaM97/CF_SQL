# CF_SQL
Contains project information for CareerFoundry Rockbuster Stealth Project
This project utilized PostgreSQL to query a relational database to answer multiple business questions to help an online movie rental company transition to a steaming platform. The insights were generated into visuals and compiled into a Tableau presentaiton for stakeholders. These SQL queries showcase some of the skills I learned during my certificate program through CareerFoundry.
